Introduction
Loan prediction is an important activity for banking and finance institutions. The goal is to predict whether an applicant will be approved for a loan based on various factors. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict loan eligibility based on applicant data.

Problem Statement
The problem is to predict the loan eligibility of applicants based on their personal and financial information. The objective is to help banks and financial institutions automate the loan approval process, minimize risks, and improve decision-making.

Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains information about loan applicants. The key features in the dataset are:

Loan_ID: Unique identifier for the loan
Gender: Male/Female
Married: Applicant marital status
Dependents: Number of dependents
Education: Applicant education level
Self_Employed: Whether the applicant is self-employed
ApplicantIncome: Applicant's income
CoapplicantIncome: Coapplicant's income
LoanAmount: Loan amount in thousands
Loan_Amount_Term: Term of the loan in months
Credit_History: Credit history meets guidelines
Property_Area: Urban/Semiurban/Rural
Loan_Status: Loan approved (Y/N)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves analyzing the dataset to summarize its main characteristics. Key steps include:

Handling Missing Values: Address missing data in the dataset.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations to understand the distribution of features.
Correlation Analysis: Analyze correlations between features and the target variable.
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves preparing the data for modeling. Key steps include:

Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical values.
Feature Scaling: Scale features to ensure they are on a similar scale.
Splitting the Data: Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Building
Various machine learning algorithms are used to build the predictive model. The models considered include:

Logistic Regression: A statistical method for binary classification.
Decision Tree: A tree-like model for decision-making.
Random Forest: An ensemble method using multiple decision trees.
Gradient Boosting: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially.
Model Evaluation
Model evaluation involves assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as:

Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions.
Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions.
Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
ROC-AUC: Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve.
Results
The results of the model evaluations are compared, and the best-performing model is selected based on the evaluation metrics. Hyperparameter tuning may be performed to optimize the model performance.
